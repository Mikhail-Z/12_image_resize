# Image Resizer

This script resizes the image, given in the first argument. Note, that you should enter both new width and height or only new scale.
Not width, height and scale at the same time. Scale may be a number less or bigger than 1.0. In the last argument you can enter path to final file. By default program generates file_XXXxYYY.jpg,
where XXX and YYY mean new width and height.

## Usage
```
python image_resizer.py input_file [width, height] [scale] [output_file]
```
